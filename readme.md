# Vim Markdown Syntax

My custom vim markdown syntax file heavily inspired by [tpope](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdownk) and [plasticboy](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown).

This is still a work in progress and I hope to add more cutsom desired functionality that I want from markdown files.
